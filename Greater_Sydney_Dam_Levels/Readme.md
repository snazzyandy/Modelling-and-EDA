A friend of mine mentioned that WaterNSW updated their website.
However, like with most web facelifts, the websites's functionality took a hit.

As a policy maker hes very interested in the daily releases of dam levels as well as the historic dataset.
Rather than him visiting the site each day and recording the data manually I wrote this basic script with github actions to scrape the site every day then kick it out as a csv.

All these daily data extracts are avaiable in the data folder.

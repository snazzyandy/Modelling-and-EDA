# Welcome to my Modelling and Exploratory Data Analysis landing page!

## What's it about

I mostly do pretty basic data science research projects at work meaning I often miss the opportunity to take the chainsaw to a teacup.

In this repo we will aim to do just that.

### Current Projects

**CHDS:** Looking at school shooting data at K-12 Sites in the USA based on data from [Center for Homeland Defence and Security](https://www.chds.us/ssdb/data-map/)


### Completed Projects

FINISHED PROJECTS!!! Are you kidding :P

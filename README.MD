## What's it about

I mostly do pretty basic data science research projects at work meaning I often miss the opportunity to take the chainsaw to a teacup.

In this repo we will aim to do just that.

### Current Projects

**CHDS:** Looking at school shooting data at K-12 Sites in the USA based on data from [Center for Homeland Defence and Security](https://www.chds.us/ssdb/data-map/)

**NBA Height-Dunk Analysis** Investigating the relationship between height and distance from completed shots in the NBA

**Greater Sydney Dam Levels** A Web scraper tool to pull dam levels across greater sydney every day until they bring back the download historic tool

### Completed Projects

Greater Syd Dam levels is done!
